#step 2: you probably want to know what the location is

#when you call string, it default calls to_s before it outputs. We can overwrite that
#so we dont get the stupid its its_address_in_memory


#step 3
# instance variables are private
# unless you tell it to tell details about it, it wonâ€™t

#there are too many lines of code to write the getter and setter methods for each attribute
